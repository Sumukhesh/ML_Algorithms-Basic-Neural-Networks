# ML_Algorithms-Basic-Neural-Networks
This repo contains the basic implentation of the neural networks. These Neural Networks are used to predict the classes of the Mnist dataset(already present in the keras)
The libraries used in the script are:
1. Tensorflow - for the usage of keras for modelling, predicting and loading the data.
2. numpy - we can process the data in terms of arrays.
3. Matplotlib - It is used to visualize the data.
